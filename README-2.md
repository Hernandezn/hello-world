tl;dr I'mma code again, this time with pay

September 22nd, 2020 -- The career path

I have a saying that for the man who's been around the world, then the only place he wants to be is the place he should call home.

After having read through that first journal entry and having lived the three years since then, it's only appropriate that I come back to something I'm passionate about. Three years ago, I was completely honest with my intentions for being here, and sure enough, I left as soon as I found some stable employment that didn't involve coding. Now that I have some professional experience and a mountain of cash under my belt, I can truly and honestly make a move for a coding profession not because I need to, but because I want to.

Since then, the professional life has already been a journey. Be warned, the rest of this reads like a really long cover letter.





As I said in the last entry, I was in the ouroboros of needing experience just to get a job to get experience to get a job, so I first settled into something completely unrelated that bordered on predatory. For about a month, I was selling insurance for a Torchmark multi-level marketing business, Liberty National Life Insurance, and the authoritarian branch leader, the boss of my boss, dropped me as soon as I turned a profit because I was writing & implementing my own sales pitches instead of buying his methods. The commission I would've earned went to him instead, and all I really lost was the gas money. No one else at the business took issue with me, and I had the favor of my direct manager, the first person who was ever really my boss. It was a decent crash course in customer-facing business communication at the grunt level, and that's the value I took away from it.

From there, I went through Express Staffing to land my first engineering-related job with Kobayashi, a Japanese pharmaceutical company keeping a single-factory operation making handwarmers & lens wipes in the US. It was my first proper nine-to-five, though I was typically in from 7 to 6 set by the example of my manager. It was officially a three-man production engineering team supplemented by a further two Japanese engineers and two maintenence workers, with me being a technician. The job paid 15 dollars an hour, enough for an honest living, and since our capital was mostly documented in Japanese, my work was mostly at the levels of implementation, testing, maintenance, and regulatory compliance. On my first day, I was hanging drywall, and on my last day, I was implementing the company's first Internet-of-Things system. I'd worked shoulder-to-shoulder with people on the floor producing product, I'd driven the forklifts & boom lift, I milled & lathed metal workpieces before welding them up, I wired up PLC-centered control boxes after self-teaching myself to read electrical schematics, I did building electrical work alongside tradesmen for building updates & upgrades, I learned & implemented ladder-logic programming for some of our PLCs, I painted walls & floors, I built crates & structures, I updated the building floor plan, I hung permanent fixtures like pipe bollards and safety equipment receptacles, I did some long shifts and a LOT of manual labor in the service of getting the job done; nothing was beyond me, and nothing was beneath me. I even got in a trip to Spain for the initial testing of a new manufacturing machine. My team and I were the body implementing physical change in the company. It was typical for me to come home with new scratches or some amount of dirt on my faceand the whole experience turned me from an academic into a skilled worker. It drove home what I now believe to be the most important skill of them all: the ability to learn new skills.

After a year with Kobayashi, I implemented the overarching project of my employment, the initial deployment of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system in the form of an Opto22 EPIC system that combined PLC I/O with an onboard server to deliver machine diagnostics in real-time from sensors that I specified and wired up into a network location that I defined and physically ran the Ethernet cables for before actually programming the device myself to deliver insights from the machine level to the business level. The plant manager asked about IoT in my initial interview, and I was honest with him that I didn't know much, but I could learn. Ultimately, it turned out that no one really knew, including industry professionals we spoke with throughout the process, since no one actually had a set definition for what IoT was in the first place.

For the record, the Internet of Things is just any framework that implements communication between some client on a computer network and sensors/actuators within a device, such that a user, computer, or even a different IoT device can receive & deliver information & commands remotely instead of having to discover or deliver it manually. For example, a motor might stick on a machine, but there's a CT ammeter on each motor's power throughput line or a rotary encoder on the motor arm, so when the motor sticks, the ammeter sensor or encoder sensor will detect the motor's output parameters, this information will go to a computer that performs post-processing to determine that it's an abnormal condition, then the computer sends out an email or other alert issuing a work order to have that specific motor checked out, then the appropriate motor is diagnosed and fixed/replaced without having to suffer potentially extra hours of downtime to find out what's happening to your operation.

Moving back to my professional journey, by the time I implemented the inaugural IoT system for Kobayashi, I was already looking for another job. There were at least a few people I went to school with casually making twice my pay with half my skillset by that point, and albeit they were typically still living the urban life in Atlanta while I was in my little home town, I really wanted to be out of my parents' house. All that time, I was still in between those four walls, but I was intent on breaking out and staying out. For the first time in my life, I was going to be free.

I signed back up with Express, and only one interview later, I landed a position as a quality engineer with a Chattanooga-based division of the car-part-manufacturing company Gestamp. My two-week notice with my first proper job was a heavy one, but it was an amicable departure. Two of us were leaving, a week apart, but the department was already hiring. A proper electrical engineer was setting up to take over where I left off. I deployed my IoT project, and the next Monday, I was in a team of trainees at Gestamp. Where Kobayashi turned me from an academic to a worker, Gestamp turned me from a worker to a professional.

This time, I was on salary, 60k a year, and my overarching project in this job was to restore relations between two of the Gestamp sister plants in Chattanooga by coordinating operations to ensure that my employer, Gestamp 1, was delivering only quality product to the customer plant, Gestamp 3, at an appropriate rate to meet Gestamp 3's production demand. The product was thick sheet-metal stampings in various complex geometries and sizes, and parts would have problems like sharp edge burrs, small splits, bends, strain thinning, contamination, or striations opening up between the crystals in the pressed metal. I could sort and/or rework parts to ensure that first, only parts within specification made it to our customer, and second, that our technicians knew which problems needed to be fixed before we ran that product again. However, due to the scale of the operations, with dozens of part types each produced in the thousands per week, the sorting and rework operations became an administrative task of coordinating teams, defining product issues such that anyone on the team would understand what to look for, collecting & logging sort results from the teams, reporting sort data insights to other teams to determine things like problem diagnoses & quality budget allocations, catching new defects as they come from the production line or are reported by the customer, and this is all done across up to three different operating sites simultaneously, having to make sure the proper information is passed from shift to shift while I didn't have an off-shift counterpart myself. If the customer found an issue on their line, I would be there within the hour, any time of day or night, and would have to set up another sort, or more often, a re-sort of parts we'd already sorted for an issue we didn't know existed until it got to the customer.

To state it more briefly, it was all very quick and confusing, even for the supervisors working under me. Goalposts changed quickly, people would raise voices, I'd need to be in multiple places at once, and it took nearly half a year of this to finally pull ahead of the growing mountains of issues that had built up and continued to build up since the months before my employment started. The whole thing was a faceless monster, and it forced me into a leadership position that I didn't expect. I calmly and purposefully took on my duties, putting out fires until I could systematize ever-improving methods for solving each new issue that came up. Only once we had a buffer of good parts, could we move on to solving our issues' root causes without the customer screaming for us to produce more parts. With the support of several teams across departments and my buddy Mike in quality engineering, we made big leaps in solving problems faster than they arose and repairing our once-sour relations with our sister plant.

The big mainstay above constitutes the majority of my struggles at Gestamp, but in the meantime, I had to look out for side projects. We were specified new parts to produce, and I had to determine whether or not parts were OK to move from testing to production, with determinations made using coordinate-based measurements, tolerances, and the dimensional consistency of test-run parts. I ran operational audits on our production processes. I milled out measuring apparatuses to make it easier to look out for dimensional defects on parts with difficult geometries. I prepared & gave out presentations of our top quality issues for our relevant teams and leadership to remain aware. I submitted suspect parts to our laboratories and interpreted the data for our relevant teams. I became a moving part of the machine, but in doing this, I freed myself from the illusion of my job title. I was in quality engineering, but I was not an engineer.

While root-causing my issues and reporting technical details required me to have some knowledge about production processes and scientific data presentation in the context of business insights, the job didn't engage my passion WITHIN engineering: my passion to create and discover. I became increasingly disenchanted with my position and had even begun seeing a psychologist to help me deal with the stress. A depression diagnosis wasn't far behind, but I soldiered on using no drug except my own personal fortitude, working quite effectively for someone supposedly in a bad state of mind who didn't have any passion for the position. Frankly, it was maddening for everyone involved in this thing that swallowed up my life, and I was at the nexus of it all. It turned out no one envied my position; a two-week notice became a two-month notice, and no one wanted to take the leash for this vicious beast. The event that calmed it down was the 2020 pandemic, and as operations shut down, I was finally able to wrap things up and make my departure, once again with goodwill from both parties.

Now, in the present, I'm less than a week away from starting an industry programming course with the coding-specialized staffing company, Revature. This is the the first job that I've chosen purely out of my interest in the subject matter. I can have a passion for this, and it'll get my foot in the door for a career in something that I actually like to do. Albeit, my parents are iffy, as Revature has seemingly devious practices like locking you in with a two-year 30k contract, emailing about a referral program in spite of allegedly being too overrun with applications at the moment to take many people in, and putting you at a minimum-wage pay scale in the event that they can't find you a position. However, with my record, I feel like I can afford to be optimistic.

The typical profile for a Revature recruit seems to be either someone wanting a higher-paying profession or a newly-graduated CS student who wants to get their foot in the door. I'm just someone who actually wants to code and has supplementary experience & skills in communication and leadership, and that's before my moral position of being damn sure to get things done when I'm being paid for it. I'm not typically a terribly positive person, but I feel like my professional capabilities are something that I can be proud of.
